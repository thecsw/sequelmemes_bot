*Hello there!*

Welcome to the source page of u/sequelmemes_bot! Nice to meet you. First of all, let me talk you through what the bot does and details later.

** Getting started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

*** Prerequisites

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
sudo pip install praw
sudo pip install python-opencv
sudo pip install pytesseract
sudo pip install tesseract-ocr
sudo pip install Pillow
sudo pip install tqdm
#+END_SRC

OR

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
1. [[https://github.com/praw-dev/praw][praw]] is Python Reddit API Wrapper. This will be the main and only package to
   connect to Reddit's API and extract desired data.
2. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python][python-opencv]] is used for image transformations and computer vision problems.
3. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytesseract][pytesseract]] is a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR.
4. [[https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Pillow]] is the Python  Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.
5. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm][tqdm]] is used for fancy progress bars.

*** Other Dependencies

Tesseract engine should be installed on a local machine to run the text
recognition properly. We will also install the tesseract OCR trained 
languages for better accuracy and we will install only the English 
packages. For more information about other languages, please refer to 
tesseract's official 
[[https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract][repository on Github]].

**** Linux

***** Debian, Ubuntu (aptitude)

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-eng
#+END_SRC

***** Arch Linux (pacman)

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
sudo pacman -S tesseract
sudo pacman -S tesseract-data-eng
#+END_SRC

**** Mac OS (homebrew)
#+BEGIN_SRC screen
brew install tesseract
#+END_SRC

** Installing

The only thing that needs to be done before execution is the config. The only
thing that needs to be done before execution is the config profile. In the
config profile you should fill your Reddit API details.

For that please follow the steps below

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
git clone https://github.com/thecsw/sequelmemes_bot
cd sequelmemes_bot
mv example.config.py config.py
nano config.py
#+END_SRC

After filling out the details, save and exit. You're done with installation.

** Deployment

Remove the word **'example'** from the title of all files with it.

Just run this

#+BEGIN_SRC screen
python main.py
#+END_SRC

That is everything. All the sequelmemes will be identified.
** Source code

   The code is heavily commented and all the important modules are being separated into different files. Looks pretty, dunno.
